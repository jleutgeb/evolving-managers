Nowadays, browsers by default limit the execution of javascript in windows that are not in focus. If you open ten tabs to test the code, the timeouts that are used for the periods will not work as they should. Instead of using whatever period length, they will default to a timeout of 1 second. Either disable the background timer throttling in Chrome or use the startup parameter --disable-background-timer-throttling in a shortcut when starting Chrome.
